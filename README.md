# Signature Authentication on Bank Cheques  

## Overview  
This project fine-tunes YOLOv5 for signature detection and uses Siamese Networks for signature verification on bank cheques. The system achieves 90% accuracy in signature detection and 80% accuracy in signature identification.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- OpenCV  
- YOLOv5  

## Key Features  
- Fine-tuned YOLOv5 for signature detection.  
- Implemented Siamese Networks for signature verification.  
- Developed data cleaning pipelines to improve model accuracy.  

## How to Run
